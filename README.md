# Hello, World! üëã I'm Melvin.


I'm a Population Health Specialist turned Software Engineer with a passion for building solutions that make a difference. After years in health, I took a leap into the tech world with a full-stack bootcamp and haven't looked back since. Currently, I'm expanding my cybersecurity knowledge through a Google course, aiming to blend my health expertise with tech to innovate in population health technologies.

## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on 

- A project that leverages AI to predict health trends within communities.
- Enhancing my full-stack development skills with a focus on React and Node.js.
- I've completed my cybersecurity course with Google's 6-month program and am now preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification


## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning 

- Advanced cybersecurity techniques to protect sensitive health data.
- Cloud computing to scale my projects efficiently.
- Data analysis and machine learning to uncover insights in population health.
