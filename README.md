## 🚀 About Me
Cybersecurity-focused professional with a strong foundation in **security operations, vulnerability management, cloud fundamentals, and technical troubleshooting**.  

I’m hands-on, process-driven, and security-first — building real skills through labs, simulations, and continuous learning rather than relying on theory alone.

My background blends **security, IT, data, and development**, allowing me to see problems from both a technical and operational perspective.
